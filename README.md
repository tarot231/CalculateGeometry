# CalculateGeometry

This plugin calculates the area of the polygon and the length of the line, in arbitrary units. Compared to using field calculator, you don't need to type calculation expressions, so you can get results with fewer steps. Even if OTF is enabled, it doesn't affect the calculation result (see bug report [#14675](https://issues.qgis.org/issues/14675)).

## FAQ
